				</hgroup>
				<p>
					<span>When by an edict of the powers supreme</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A poet’s born into this world’s drab space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mother starts, in horror, to blaspheme</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clenching her fists at God, who grants her grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Would that a nest of vipers I’d aborted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rather than this absurd abomination.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cursed be the night of pleasures vainly sported</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which my womb conceived my expiation.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Since of all women I am picked by You</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be my Mate’s aversion and his shame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And since I cannot, like a billet-doux,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Consign this stunted monster to the flame,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I’ll turn the hatred, which You load on me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the curst tool through which You work your spite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And twist and stunt this miserable tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until it cannot burgeon for the blight.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She swallows down the white froth of her ire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, knowing naught of schemes that are sublime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deep in Gehenna, starts to lay the pyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s consecrated to maternal crime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet with an unseen Angel for protector</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The outcast waif grows drunken with the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And finds ambrosia, too, and rosy nectar</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all he eats or drinks, suspecting none.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He sings upon his Via Crucis, plays</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With winds, and with the clouds exchanges words:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Spirit following his pilgrim-ways</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeps to behold him gayer than the birds.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Those he would love avoid him as in fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or, growing bold to see one so resigned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Compete to draw from him a cry or tear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And test on him the fierceness of their kind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In food or drink that’s destined for his taste</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They mix saliva foul with cinders black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drop what he’s touched with hypocrite distaste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And blame themselves for walking in his track.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His wife goes crying in the public way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>—“Since fair enough he finds me to adore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The part of ancient idols I will play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gild myself with coats of molten ore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I will get drunk on incense, myrrh, and nard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On genuflexions, meat, and heady wine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of his crazed and wondering regard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll laugh to steal prerogatives divine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When by such impios farces bored at length,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll place my frail strong hand on him, and start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With nails like those of harpies in their strength,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To plough myself a pathway to his heart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like a young bird that trembles palpitating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll wrench his heart, all crimson, from his chest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to my favourite beast, his hunger sating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will fling it in the gutter with a jest.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Skyward, to where he sees a Throne blaze splendid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pious Poet lifts his arms on high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the vast lightnings of his soul extended</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blot out the crowds and tumults from his eye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Blessèd be You, O God, who give us pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As cure for our impurity and wrong⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Essence that primes the stalwart to sustain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seraphic raptures that were else too strong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I know that for the Poet You’ve a post,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the blest Legions take their ranks and stations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Invited to the revels with the host</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Virtues, Powers, and Thrones, and Dominations.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That grief’s the sole nobility, I know it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where neither Earth nor Hell can make attacks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that, to deck my mystic crown of poet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All times and universes paid their tax.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But all the gems from old Palmyra lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ores unmixed, the pearls of the abyss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Set by Your hand, could not suffice the cost</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of such a blazing diadem as this.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Because it will be only made of light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drawn from the hearth of the essential rays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To which our mortal eyes, when burning bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are but the tarnished mirrors that they glaze.”</span>

					<span>Snare the great albatrosses of the deep,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Scarce have they fished aboard these airy kings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When helpless on such unaccustomed floors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They piteously droop their huge white wings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And trail them at their sides like drifting oars.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How comical, how ugly, and how meek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appears this soarer of celestial snows!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One, with his pipe, teases the golden beak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One, limping, mocks the cripple as he goes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Poet, like this monarch of the clouds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Despising archers, rides the storm elate.</span>

				<p>
					<span>I love the thought of those old naked days</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Phoebus gilded torsos with his rays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When men and women sported, strong and fleet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without anxiety or base deceit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heaven caressed them, amorously keen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To prove the health of each superb machine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cybele then was lavish of her guerdon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And did not find her sons too gross a burden:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, like a she-wolf, in her love great-hearted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her full brown teats to all the world imparted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bold, handsome, strong Man, rightly, might evince</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pride in the glories that proclaimed him prince—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fruits pure of outrage, by the blight unsmitten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With firm, smooth flesh that cried out to be bitten.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Today the Poet, when he would assess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those native splendours in the nakedness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of man or woman, feels a sombre chill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enveloping his spirit and his will.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He meets a gloomy picture, which he loathes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherin deformity cries out for clothes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh comic runts! of horror of burlesque!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lank, flabby, skewed, pot-bellied, and grotesque!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom their smug god, Utility (poor brats!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has swaddled in his brazen clouts "ersatz"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As with cheap tinsel. Women tallow-pale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both gnawed and nourished by debauch, who trail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heavy burden of maternal vice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or of fecundity the hideous price.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We have (corrupted nations) it is true</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beauties the ancient people never knew—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sad faces gnawed by cancers of the heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And charms which morbid lassitudes impart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But these inventions of our tardy muse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can't force our ailing peoples to refuse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just tribute to the holiness of youth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With its straightforward mien, its forhead couth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The limpid gaze, like running water brigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Diffusing, careless, through all things, like the light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of azure skies, the birds, the winds, the flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The songs, and perfumes, and heart-warming powers.</span>

					<span>Rage of the boxer, mischief of the faun,</span>

					<span>Crones ogle mirrors; children scarcely dressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adjust their hose to tantalise the devils.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A lake of gore where fallen angels dwell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is Delacroix, by firwoods ever fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where under fretful skies strange fanfares swell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like Weber's sighs and heartbeats in the air.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>These curses, blasphemies, and lamentations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These ecstasies, tears, cries and soaring psalms—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through endless mazes, their reverberations</span>

					<span>Bring, to our mortal hearts, divinest balms.</span>

				<p>
					<span>A thousand sentinels repeat the cry.</span>

					<span>A thousand trumpets echo. Beacon-tossed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand summits flare it through the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A call of hunters in the jungle lost.</span>
				</p>
				<p>

					<span>Proof of our worth and value, Oh Divinity,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That, having forced indifferent hearts to shed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tears of emotion, moved to depths profound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And having to celestial glory found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marvellous paths, to his own self unknown,</span>

					<span>Where only purest souls had fared alone—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a man raised too high, as in a panic,</span>

					<span>He cried "Poor Christ, I've raised you to renown!</span>

					<span>But had I wished to bring you crashing down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Probing your flaws, your shame would match your pride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you'd be but a foetus to deride!"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Immediately he felt his wits escape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That flash of sunlight veiled itself in crêpe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All chaos through his intellect was rolled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A temple once, containing hoards of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By opulence and order well controlled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And topped with ceilings splendid to behold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silence and night installed their reign in him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed he was a cellar dank and dim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To which no living man could find the key;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from that day a very beast was he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while he wandered senseless on his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not knowing spring from summer, night from day,</span>

					<span>Foul, dirty, useless, and with no hereafter,</span>

					<span>This summer morn when warmth and beauty mingle—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the path's turn, a carcase lay asprawl</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a bed of shingle.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Legs raised, like some old whore far-gone in passion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The burning, deadly, poison-sweating mass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Opened its paunch in careless, cynic fashion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ballooned with evil gas.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>On this putrescence the sun blazed in gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cooking it to a turn with eager care—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So to repay to Nature, hundredfold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What she had mingled there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sky, as on the opening of a flower,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On thhis superb obscenity smiled bright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stench drove at us, with such fearsome power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You thought you'd swoon outright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Flies trumpeted upon the rotten belly</span>

					<span>Whence larvae poured in legions far and wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And flowed, like molten and liquescent jelly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down living rags of hide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The mass ran down, or, like a wave elated</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rolled itself on, and crackled as if frying:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You'd think that corpse, by vague breath animated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew life from multiplying.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Through that strange world a rustling rumour ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like rushing water or a gust of air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or grain that winnowers, with rhythmic fan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sweep simmering here and there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It seemed a dream after the forms grew fainter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or like a sketch that slowly seems to dawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On a forgotten canvas, which the painter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From memory has drawn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Behind the rocks a restless cur that slunk</span>

					<span class="i1">That he had torn from thence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet you'll resemble this infection too</span>

					<span>One day, and stink and sprawl in such a fashion,</span>

					<span>Star of my eyes, sun of my nature, you,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Yes, you must come to this, O queen of graces,</span>

					<span>At length, when the last sacraments are over,</span>

					<span>And you go down to moulder in dark places</span>

					<span>Then tell the vermin as it takes its pleasance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And feasts with kisses on that face of yours,</span>

						<span>A fine strong gentle cat is prowling</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As in his bedroom, in my brain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So soft his voice, so smooth its strain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That you can scarcely hear him miowling.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But should he venture to complain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or scold, the voice is rich and deep:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thus he manages to keep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The charm of his untroubled reign.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This voice, which seems to pearl and filter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through my soul's inmost shady nook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fills me with poems, like a book,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fortifies me, like a philtre.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>His voice can cure the direst pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And it contains the rarest raptures.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The deepest meanings, which it captures,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It needs no language to explain.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>There is no bow that can so sweep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That perfect instrument, my heart:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or make more sumptuous music start</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From its most vibrant cord and deep,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Than can the voice of this strange elf,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This cat, bewitching and seraphic,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Subtly harmonious in his traffic</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all things else, and with himself.</span>

						<span>So sweet a perfume seems to swim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of his fur both brown and bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I nearly was embalmed one night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From (only once) caressing him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Familiar Lar of where I stay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rules, presides, inspires and teaches</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All things to which his empire reaches.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perhaps he is a god, or fay.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>When to a cherished cat my gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is magnet-drawn and then returns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Back to itself, it there discerns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With strange excitement and amaze,</span>

					<p>
						<span>Deep down in my own self, the rays</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And in the darkest corner of my heart,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Scoop you a niche, with gold and azure glaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where you would stand in wonderment and gaze,</span>

					<span>With my pure verses trellised, and all round</span>

					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Barbarous, stiff, and heavy with my doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereon as in a fourm you would fill out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mould your lair. Of tears, not pearls, would be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sparkle of its rich embroidery:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your robe would be my lust, with waving flow,</span>

					<span>The Month of Rains, incensed at life, outpours</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of her urn, a dark chill, like a penance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the graveyards and their wan, grey tenants</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And folk in foggy suburbs out of doors.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My cat seeks out a litter on the ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twitching her scrawny body flecked with mange.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soul of some old poet seems to range</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gutter, with a chill phantasmal sound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The big bell tolls: damp hearth-logs seem to mock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whistling, the sniffle-snuffle of the clock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While in the play of odours stale with must,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Reminders of a dropsical old crone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The knave of hearts and queen of spades alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Darkly discuss a passion turned to dust.</span>

					<span>I have more memories than had I seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ten centuries. A huge chest that has been</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stuffed full of writs, bills, verses, balance-sheets</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With golden curls wrapt up in old receipts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And love-letters—hides less than my sad brain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pyramid, a vault that must contain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More corpses than the public charnel stores.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am a cemetery the moon abhors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where, like remorses, the long worms that trail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Always the dearest of my dead assail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am a boudoir full of faded roses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where many an old outmoded dress reposes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And faded pastels and pale Bouchers only</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Breathe a scent-flask, long-opened and left lonely…</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nothing can match those limping days for length</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where under snows of years, grown vast in strength,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Boredom (of listlessness the pale abortion)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of immortality takes the proportion!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>—From henceforth, living matter, you are nought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But stone surronded by a dreadful thought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lost in some dim Sahara, an old Sphinx,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of whom the world we live in never thinks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lost on the map, it is its surly way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only to sing in sunset's fading ray.</span>

					<span>I'm like the King of some damp, rainy clime,</span>

					<span>Grown impotent and old before my time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who scorns the bows and scrapings of his teachers</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Naught can amuse him, falcon, steed, or chase:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No, not the mortal plight of his whole race</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dying before his balcony. The tune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sung to this tyrant by his pet buffoon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Irks him. His couch seems far more like a grave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even the girls, for whom all kings seem brave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can think no toilet up, nor shameless rig,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To draw a smirk from this funereal prig.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sage who makes him gold, could never find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The baser element that rots his mind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even those blood-baths the old Romans knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And later thugs have imitated too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can't warm this skeleton to deeds of slaughter,</span>

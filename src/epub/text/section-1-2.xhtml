					<span>More chasteness to my eclogues it would give,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sky-high, like old astrologers to live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A neighbour of the belfries: and to hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their solemn hymns along the winds career.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>High in my attic, chin in hand, I'd swing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And watch the workshops as they roar and sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The city's masts—each steeple, tower, and flue—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And skies that bring eternity to view.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sweet, through the mist, to see illumed again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stars through the azure, lamps behind the pane,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rivers of carbon irrigate the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the pale moon pour magic from on high.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I'd watch three seasons passing by, and then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When winter came with dreary snows, I'd pen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Myself between closed shutters, bolts, and doors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And build my fairy palaces indoors.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A dream of blue horizons I would garble</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thoughts of fountains weeping on to marble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of gardens, kisses, birds that ceaseless sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the Idyll holds of childhood's spring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The riots, brawling past my window-pane,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From off my desk would not divert my brain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because I would be plunged in pleasure still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Conjuring up the Springtime with my will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forcing sunshine from my heart to form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of burning thoughts, an atmosphere that's warm.</span>

					<span>Your body, as you show it,</span>

					<span>With freckles on your arms,</span>

					<span>A dagger made of gold,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flash on your thigh:</span>

				<p>

					<span>Which, fettered by your beauty,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Riffraff of scullion-rhymers</span>

						<span>Andromanche!—This shallow stream, the brief</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mirror you once so grandly overcharged</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With your vast majesty of widowed grief,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This lying Simoïs your tears enlarged,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Evoked your name, and made me think of you,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I was crossing the new Carrousel.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>—Old Paris is no more (cities renew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quicker than human hearts, their changing spell).</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>In mind I see that camp of huts, the muddle</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of rough-hewn roofs and leaning shafts for miles,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The grass, green logs stagnating in the puddle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where bric-a-brac lay glittering in piles.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Once a menagerie parked there. And there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It chanced one morning, when from slumber freed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Labour stands up, and Transport through still air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rumbles its sombre hurricane of speed,—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A swan escaped its cage: and as its feet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With finny palms on the harsh pavement scraped,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trailing white plumage on the stony street,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the dry gutter for fresh water gaped.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Nervously bathing in the dust, in wonder</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It asked, remembering its native stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"When will the rain come down? When roll the thunder?"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see it now, strange myth and fatal theme!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Sometimes, like Ovid's wretch, towards the sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Ironically blue with cruel smile)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its neck, convulsive, reared its head on high</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though it were its Maker to revile.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span>Paris has changed, but in my grief no change.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New palaces and scaffoldings and blocks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To me, are allegories, nothing strange.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My memories are heavier than rocks.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Passing the Louvre, one image makes me sad:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That swan, like other exiles that we knew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grandly absurd, with gestures of the mad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gnawed by one craving!—Then I think of you,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Who fell from your great husband's arms, to be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A beast of freight for Pyrrhus, and for life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bowed by an empty tomb in ecstacy—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great Hector's widow! Helenus's wife!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I think, too, of the starved and phthisic negress</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tramping the mud, who seeks, with haggard eye,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The palms of Africa, and for some egress</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of this great black wall of foggy sky:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Of those who've lost what they cannot recover:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of those who slake with tears their lonely hours</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And milk the she-wolf, Sorrow, for their mother:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And skinny orphans withering like flowers.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So in the forest of my soul's exile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembrance winds his horn as on he rides.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I think of sailors stranded on an isle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Captives, and slaves—and many more besides.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Ant-seething city, city full of dreams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where ghosts by daylight tug the passer's sleeve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mystery, like sap, through all its conduit-streams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quickens the dread Colossus that they weave.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One early morning, in the street's sad mud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose houses, by the fog increased in height,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemed wharves along a riverside in flood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When with a scene to match the actor's plight,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Foul yellow mist had filled the whole of space:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Steeling my nerves to play a hero's part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I coaxed my weary soul with me to pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The backstreets shaken by each lumbering cart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A wretch appeared whose tattered, yellow clothing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Matching the colour of the raining skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could make it shower down alms—but for the loathing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Malevolence that glittered in his eyes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The pupils of his eyes, with bile injected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemed with their glance to make the frost more raw.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stiff as a sword, his long red beard projected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like that of Judas, level with his jaw.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He was not bent, but broken, with the spine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forming a sharp right-angle to the straight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that his stick, to finish the design,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gave him the stature and the crazy gait</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of a three-footed Jew, or crippled hound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He plunged his soles into the slush as though</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To crush the dead; and to the world around</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemed less of an indifferent than a foe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His image followed him, (back, stick, and beard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In nothing differed) spawned from the same hole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A centenarian twin. Both spectres steered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the same gait to the same unknown goal.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To what foul plot was I exposed? of what</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Humiliating hazard made the jeer?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For seven times, (I counted) was begot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This sinister, self multiplying fear!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let him mark well who laughs at my despair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With no fraternal shudder in reply…</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those seven loathsome monsters had the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though rotting through, of what can never die.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Disgusting Phoenix, his own sire and father!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could I have watched an eight instalment spawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ironic, fateful, grim—nor perished rather?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But from that hellish cortege I'd withdrawn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Perplexed as drunkards when their sight is doubled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I locked my room, sick, fevered, chilled with fright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all my spirit sorely hurt and troubled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By so ridiculous yet strange a sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Vainly my reason for the helm was striving:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tempest of my efforts made a scorn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My soul like a dismasted wreck went driving</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over a monstrous sea without a bourn.</span>

						<span>Where all things, even horror, turn to grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I follow, in obedience to my whim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strange, feeble, charming creatures round the place.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>These crooked freaks were women in their pride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fair Eponine or Laïs! Humped and bent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Love them! Because they still have souls inside.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under their draughty skirts in tatters rent,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They crawl: a vicious wind their carrion rides;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the deep roar of traffic see them cower,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pressing like precious relics to their sides</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some satchel stitched with mottoes or a flower.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They trot like marionettes along the level,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or drag themselves like wounded deer, poor crones!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or dance, against their will, as if the devil</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were swinging in the belfry of their bones.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Cracked though they are, their eyes are sharp as drills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shine, like pools of water in the night,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The eyes of little girls whom wonder thrills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To laugh at all that sparkles and is bright.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The coffins of old women very often</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are near as small as those of children are.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wise Death, who makes a symbol of a coffin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Displays a taste both charming and bizarre.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And when I track some feeble phantom fleeing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through Paris's immense ant-swarming Babel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I always think that such a fragile being</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is moving softly to another cradle.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Unless, sometimes, in geometric mood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see the strange deformities they offer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I muse how often he who saws the wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Must change the shape and outline of the coffer.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Those eyes are wells a million teardrops feed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crucibles spangled by a cooling ore,</span>

						<span>Invincible in charm to all that breed</span>
						<br/>

						<span>To listen to the music, rich in metal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That's played by bands of soldiers in the parks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On golden, soul-reviving eyes, to fettle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From meek civilian hearts, heroic sparks.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This one was straight and stiff, in carriage regal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She breathed the warrior-music through her teeth,</span>

					<span>Obstinant thinkers drowsy in the head,</span>

					<span>And toil-bent workmen groping to their bed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But insalubrious demons of the airs,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>On every side it weaves its hidden tracks</span>

					<span>Like enemies preparing night-attacks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It squirms within the City's breast of mire,</span>

					<span>It is the hour when sick men's pains increase.</span>

					<span>Proud, as a living person, of her height,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her scarf and gloves and huge bouquet of roses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She shows such nonchalance and ease as might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thin coquette excessive in her poses.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who, at a ball, has seen a form so slim?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her sumptuous skirts extravagantly shower</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To a dry foot that, exquisitely trim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her footwear pinches, dainty as a flower.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The frills that rub her collarbone, and feel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a lascivious rill against a rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The charms she is so anxious to conceal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Defend them, too, from ridicule and mock.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her eyes are formed of emptiness and shade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her skull, with flowers so deftly decked about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon her dainty vertebrae is swayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh what a charm when nullity tricks out!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>"Caricature," some might opine, but wrongly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose hearts, too drunk with flesh that runs to waste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ignore the grace of what upholds so strongly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tall skeleton, you match my dearest taste!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Come you to trouble with your strong grimace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The feast of life? Or has some old desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rowelled your living carcase from its place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sent you, credulous, to feed its fire?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With tunes of fiddles and the flames of candles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hope you to chase the nightmare far apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or with a flood of orgies, feasts, and scandals</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To quench the hell that's lighted in your heart?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Exhaustless well of follies and of faults,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the old woe the alembic and the urn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around your trellised ribs, in new assaults,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the insatiable serpent turn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I fear your coquetry's not worth the strain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The prize not worth the effort you prolong.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could mortal hearts your railleries explain?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The joys of horror only charm the strong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The pits of your dark eyes dread fancies breathe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And vertigo. Among the dancers prudent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hope not your sixteen pairs of smiling teeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will ever find a contemplative student.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet who's not squeezed a skeleton with passion?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ravened with his kisses on the meat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of charnels. What of costume, scent, or fashion?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The man who feigns disgust, betrays conceit.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O noseless geisha, unresisted gouge!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell these fastidious feigners, from your husk—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Proud fondling fools, in spite of talc and rouge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You smell of death. Anatomies of musk,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Withered Antinoüses, beaux of dunder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Corpses in varnish, Lovelaces of bone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dance of death, with universal thunder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is whirling you to places yet unknown!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From Seine to Ganges frolicking about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You see not, through a black hole in the ceiling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a great blunderbus, with funnelled snout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Angel's trumpet, on the point of pealing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In every clime, Death studies your devices</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And vain contortions, laughable Humanity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And oft, like you, perfumes herself with spices</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mixing her irony with your insanity!"</span>

					<span>I have known deep, sad eyes that yet concealed</span>

					<span>No secrets: caskets void of any gem:</span>

					<span>Medallions where no sacred charm lay sealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deep as the Skies, but vacuous like them!</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Not trees, but colonnades, enclosed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Motionless lakes, besides whose shelves</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gigantic naiades reposed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like women, gazing at themselves.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Blue sheets of water interlay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unnumbered quays of green and rose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That stretched a million leagues away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the bounds of space impose.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas formed of unknown stones that blazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And magic waves that intersect,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where icebergs floated, seeming dazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all they mirror and reflect.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Impassive, cold, and taciturn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great Ganges, through the sky's vast prism,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each poured the treasures of its urn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into a diamond abysm.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Architect of my fairy scene,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I willed, by wondrous stratagems,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An ocean, tamed, to pass between</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A tunnel that was made of gems.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>There all things, even the colour black,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed irridescently to play,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And liquid crystalised its lack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of outline in a frozen ray.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>No star, no sun could be discerned,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Even low down, in that vast sky:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fire was personal that burned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To show these marvels to the eye.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Above these moving wonders sheer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There soared (that such a thing should be!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All for the eye, none for the ear!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A silence of eternity.</span>

						<span>My opening eyes, as red as coal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horror of my lodging met.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I felt re-entering my soul</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The knife of cares and vain regret.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The clock with brutal accent played</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Funereal chimes. The time was noon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And heaven covered, with its shade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The world, this fatuous balloon!</span>

				</hgroup>
				<p>
					<span>Reveillé in the barracks and the camps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wind of morning blew upon the lamps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was the hour when evil dreams in swarms</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On pillows twist brown, adolescent forms:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When like a bleeding eye that's twitched with pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each lantern smudged the day with crimson stain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soul, against its body's weight of brawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay struggling, like the lanterns with the dawn:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a sad face whose tears the breezes dry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The air grew tremulous with things that fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And women tired of love, and men of writing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The chimneys, here and there, showed fires were lighting.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Women of pleasure, slumber to be-slut,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay open-mouthed with livid eyelids shut.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dangling thin dugs, cold pauper-women blew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the embers and their fingers too.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was the hour when, what with cold and squalor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Women in labour aggravate their dolour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like a sob, choked short with bloody froth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cock-crow tore the foggy air as cloth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like seas the mists round every building poured</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While agonising patients in the ward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In broken hiccoughs, rattled out their lives:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And worn-out rakes reeled homeward to their wives.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aurora, in a shift of rose and green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came shivering down the Seine's deserted scene</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Paris, as he rubbed his eyes, began</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sort his tools, laborious old man.</span>

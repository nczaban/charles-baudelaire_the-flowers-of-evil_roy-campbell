					<span>Always the Demon fidgets here beside me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swims around, impalpable as air:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I drink him, feel him burn the lungs inside me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With endless evil longings and despair.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sometimes, knowing my love of Art, he uses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seductive forms of women: and has thus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With specious, hypocritical excuses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accustomed me to philtres infamous.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Leading me wayworn into wastes untrod</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of boundless Boredom, out of sight of God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Using all baits to compass my abduction,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Into my eyes, confused and full of woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soiled clothes and bleeding gashes he will throw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the grim regalia of Destruction.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Amongst gilt fabrics, flasks of scent and wine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rich furniture, white marble, precious moulds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fine paintings, and rich, perfumed robes that shine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swirled into sumptuous folds,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In a warm room, that like a hot-house stifles</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With dangerous and fatal breath, where lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pale flowers in crystal tombs, exquisite trifles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exhaling their last sigh—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A headless corpse, cascading in a flood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hot, living blood, that soaks, with crimson stain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pillow slaked and sated with blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any field with rain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like those pale visions which the gloom aborts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which fix us in a still, hypnotic stare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The head, tricked out with gems of sorts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In its huge mass of hair,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like a ranunculous beside the bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rests on the table, empty of all thought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From eyes revulsed, like twilight, seems to spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gaze that looks at naught,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon the bed the carcase, unabashed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shows, in complete abandon, without shift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The secret splendour that, in life, it flashed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Superbly, Nature's gift.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A rosy stocking, freaked with clocks of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clings to one leg: a souvenir, it seems:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The garter, from twin diamonds, with the cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stare of a viper gleams.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The singular effect of solitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of a languorous portait, with its eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Provocative as is its attitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dark loves would advertise—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And guilty joys, with feasts of strange delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full of infernal kisses, omens certain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To please the gloating angels of the Night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who swim behind each curtain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And yet to see her nimble strength, the risky</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swerve of the rounded shoulder, and its rake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tented haunch, the figure lithe and frisky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flexed like an angry snake,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You'd know that she was young. Her soul affronted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her senses stung with boredom—were they bayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By packs of wandering, lost desires, and hunted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And finally betrayed?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The vengeful man, whose lust you could not sate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(In spite of much love) nor quench his fire—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did he on your dead flesh then consummate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His monstrous, last desire?—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Answer me, corpse impure! With fevered fist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grim visage, did he raise you up on high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as your silver frosty teeth he kissed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bib you his last goodbye?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Far from inquiring magistrates that sneer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far from this world of raillery and riot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sleep peacefully, strange creature, on your bier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of mystery and quiet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Your lover roams the world. Your deathless shape</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Watches his sleep and hears each indrawn breath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more than you can he ever escape</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From constancy till death!</span>

					<span>Foot seeking foot, hand magnetising hand,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Others who deal with scapulars and hoods</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hiding the whiplash under their long train,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mingle, on lonely nights in sombre woods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The foam of pleasure with the tears of pain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O demons, monsters, virgins, martyrs, you</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who trample base reality in scorn,</span>

					<span>Whether as nuns or satyrs you pursue</span>

				<p>
					<span>You, whom my soul has tracked to lairs infernal,</span>

					<span>My blood in waves seems sometimes to be spouting</span>

					<span>As though in rhythmic sobs a fountain swooned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear its long, low, rushing sound till, doubting,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Across the town, as in the lists of battle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It flows, transforming paving stones to isles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slaking the thirst of creatures, men, and cattle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And colouring all nature red for miles.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sometimes I've sought relief in precious wines</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lull in me the fear that undermines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But found they sharpened every sense the more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I've also sought forgetfulness in lust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But love's a bed of needles, and they thrust</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give more drink to each rapacious whore.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Queen of my heart, the peerless, only one,</span>

				<p>
					<span>My heart, a bird, seemed joyfully to fly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And round the rigging cruised with nimble gyre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The vessel rolled beneath the cloudless sky</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a white angel, drunk with solar fire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What is that sad, black island like a pall?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why, Cytherea, famed in many a book,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Eldorado of old-stagers. Look:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It's but a damned poor country after all!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Isle of sweet secrets and heart-feasting fire!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of antique Venus the majestic ghost</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rolls like a storm of fragrance from your coast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Filling our souls with langour and desire!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Isle of green myrtles, where each flower uncloses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adored by nations till the end of time:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sighs of adoring hearts, like incense, climb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pour their perfume over sheaves of roses,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or groves of turtles in an endless coo!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But no! it was a waste where nothing grows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Torn only by the raucous cries of crows:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet there a curious object rose in view.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This was no temple hid in bosky trees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the young priestess, amorous of flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom secretly a loving flame devours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Walks with her robe half-open to the breeze.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For as we moved inshore to coast the shallows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And our white canvas scared the crows to fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a tall cypress, blackened on the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We saw it was a gaunt three-forking gallows.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fierce birds, perched on their meal, began to slash</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rip with rage a rotten corpse that swung.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each screwed and chiselled with its beak among</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The crisp and bleeding crannies of the hash.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His eyes were holes: from open stomach direly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His heavy tripes cascaded to his thighs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gorged with such ghastly dainties to the eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His torturers had gelded him entirely.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Beneath, some jealous prowling quadrupeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With lifted muzzles, for the leavings scrambled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The largest seemed, as in the midst he gambolled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An executioner among his aides.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Native of Cytherea's cloudless clime</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In silent suffering you paid the price,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And expiated ancient cults of vice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With generations of forbidden crime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ridiculous hanged man! Your griefs I know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I felt, to see you swing above the heath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like nausea slowly rising to my teeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bilious stream of ancient human woe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Poor devil, dear to memory! before me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I seemed to feel each talon, fang, and beak</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the stinking crows and panthers sleek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in my lifetime ever chewed and tore me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sky was charming and the sea unclouded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all was black and bloody to my mind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in a dismal winding-sheet entwined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My heart was in this allegory shrouded.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A gallows where my image hung apart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was all I found on Venus' isle of sighs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O God, give me the strength to scrutinise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without disgust, my body and my heart!</span>
